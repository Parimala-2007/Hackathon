 📌 Project Overview
Hello, I’ll quickly explain our website and what problem it solves.  
This website is a *Fingerprint Tracing Web Application* designed to show how fingerprint-like patterns can be extracted from a hand image and securely managed through a user account.

🔐 Login & User Account
First, the user creates an account or logs in.  
This ensures that every upload and report is securely linked to the correct user.

 🖼 Image Upload & Processing
After login, the user uploads a hand or finger image in *JPG or PNG format*.  
Once uploaded, the system automatically:
- Converts the image to black and white  
- Detects edges to trace fingerprint-like patterns  

The focus is on demonstrating a *clear and understandable fingerprint tracing process*, not perfect biometric accuracy.

 📄 PDF Report Generation
After processing, the system generates a *PDF report* that includes:
- Processed fingerprint image  
- User’s name  
- Date and time  

The user can instantly download this report for documentation or verification.

 💳 Subscription & Payment Feature
The application includes a *subscription system*:
- *Free Plan* – Limited usage  
- *Pro Plan* – Unlimited uploads and clean PDFs  

Payments are handled in *demo/test mode*, so no real money is involved.  
Features are automatically enabled or restricted based on the selected plan.

 🔒 Security & Access Control
All important checks happen on the *backend*, ensuring:
- Paid features cannot be accessed without authorization  
- Fair usage and basic security controls  
## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete *end-to-end system*:
- User authentication  
- Image upload  
- Fingerprint tracing  
- PDF generation  
- Subscription-based access  

The main goal is to present a *working, scalable, and easy-to-understand solution*, not a complex biometric system.
